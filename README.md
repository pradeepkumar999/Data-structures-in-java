## Introduction

Data structures are fundamental building blocks in computer science and programming. They allow us to organize and manipulate data efficiently. This repository aims to provide resources and examples to help you learn and master data structures in Java.

## Available Data Structures

This repository covers a wide range of data structures commonly used in Java programming:

- **Array**: A fundamental data structure for storing a collection of elements of the same type.
- **Linked List**: A dynamic data structure that consists of a sequence of elements connected via pointers.
- **Stack**: A linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.
- **Queue**: A linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.
- **Tree**: Various tree structures, including Binary Tree, AVL Tree, and Red-Black Tree.
- **Graph**: Graph data structures and algorithms, including Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).

## How to Use

### Code Examples

In the `code_examples` directory, you will find Java code examples for each data structure. Each example includes comments explaining the implementation and usage. You can explore these examples to understand how each data structure works.

### Tutorials

We've included detailed tutorials in the `tutorials` directory to help you learn data structures step by step. These tutorials cover:

- Creating and using data structures.
- Common operations and algorithms associated with each data structure.
- Best practices and tips for efficient use.

### Documentation

For additional reference and in-depth explanations, we recommend referring to the official Java documentation and online resources. You can find links to relevant documentation in the `docs` directory.
